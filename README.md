anomaly-detection
=================

statistically based anomaly detection system using R/shiny

These scripts are designed to work with R/shiny and require that to be installed.  They need to be dropped into their 
own seperate folder as an "app", and then can be run on a csv.

The CSV needs to either match the format used here, described in the server file, or, the file can be modified to fit the 
data.  Either way, some modification is likely necessary before the program will function.
